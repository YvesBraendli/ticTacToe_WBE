## Connect 4
## General
In this project a Match 4 game was implemented, which is provided as a Javascript application and under Github Pages. 
## Gameplay
In this game it is possible to save the current game state either on an external server (Attention: not executable here, because external express server must be
started and configured before beeing able to use that function) or directly in the browser and also from there can be reloaded via the appropriate
buttons. Furthermore it is possible to undo every move step by step and also to start a new game with a button.
##Notifications
Above the game board it is indicated which player's turn it is and also which player has won the game, if this is the case.
When a winner is determined, the current game can no longer be played, but all buttons are still functional.
## Group
Tristan Kindle and Yves Br√§ndli worked together on this project.
